How do you bind data in React? The first input field example is data binding in React.
Data-binding = when data changes in an element, the bound element gets updated to reflect this change.
In ReactJS, components are rendered to the user interface and the component’s logic contains the data to be displayed in the view(UI). The connection between the data to be displayed in the view and the component’s logic is called data binding in ReactJS.

What is validation?
The action or process of checking or proving the validity or accuracy of the data.
The main purpose to validation is to get a desired data from users. In addition, to prevent malicious users and data.

What are event types do you use to validate an input?
Validation can be done in client side or sever side. As React is front-end, we will be using client-side.
