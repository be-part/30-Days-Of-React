Exercises: Level 1

Conclusions:
30DaysofReact had a good structure that clearly displayed many of the key elements of React.
Some of it, while no longer relevant or now outdated due to the course being written during 16.13.1, was still interesting to learn about just to understand some of the changes made over various updates. 
I think the projects could have more closely aligned with the skills each day teaches you and some of the days exercise challenges are missing or are repeats of previous days. 
Overall, it was a great way to organise my independent learning and gave me some great ideas for projects and ways to challenge myself.
