What are component life cycles?
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.


What is the purpose of life cycles?


What are the three stages of a component life cycle?
The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.


What does mounting mean?
Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.


What does updating mean?
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.
A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.


What does unmounting mean?
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.
